A collaborative project with [@n1md7](https://github.com/n1md7)â€”an IoT device manager for home automation. Built with Arduino and a collection of microcontrollers, this system enables seamless device management. I'm working on the frontend to fetch and control all connected microcontrollers efficiently.
