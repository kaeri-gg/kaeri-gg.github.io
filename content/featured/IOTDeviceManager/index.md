A collaborative project with [@n1md7](https://github.com/n1md7)â€”an IoT device manager for home automation.
Built for Arduino, EP32 and other collection of microcontrollers, this system enables seamless device management.
I'm working on the frontend to fetch and control all connected microcontrollers efficiently.
